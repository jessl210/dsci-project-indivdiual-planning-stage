Their names and hashed emails do not help since the information is not directly related to the game and subscription choice. To determine how these features differ between various player types, I can split the data by player type (5 levels of experience) and apply a predictive method to each group separately. After, I can report the model’s accuracy estimate and standard error to observe its accuracy in predicting a player’s subscription. "

    "# (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use K-nearest neighbors classification and use the predictor variables, experience, number of hours played, and age, to predict a player’s newsletter subscription in the players dataset. This method is appropriate because it predicts the value of a categorical variable of interest. In this project, the categorical variable is subscription and its values are “TRUE” and “FALSE”.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply k-NN classification, it is assumed that the data is standardized (centered and scaled), all predictors are equally important, and all missing data are removed and imputed by their mean values based on other observations in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The k-NN classification model requires variables with numerical values, which only the variables played_hours and Age satisfy. Hence, using gender as a predictor is not possible unless changed to a numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The number of observations for the 5 datasets (corresponding to the player’s experience) range from 14 to 63. This will limit the amount of cross-validation folds on each training set, which limits the number of times certain K values are tested, affecting the accuracy of the model. For example, the \"Pro\" dataset only has 14 observations. Splitting 14 observations into training and testing data and performing a 5 fold cross validation will result in ~2 observations to test on. Because k-NN computes the distance between the new observation and each observation in the training set, it is difficult to perform without a large dataset. Thus, due to limited data, cross validation will only be used for observations > 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, split the data according to the players’ experience in the game (Amateur, Beginner, Regular, Pro, Veteran). This will create 5 datasets. To compare and select the model for each dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use 80% of the training data for the training set and 20% for the validation set.\n",
    "2. Create a 5 fold cross validation on the training data for the datasets > 30 observations.\n",
    "3. Preprocessing - create a recipe and standardize the data. Played_hours has a larger scale than Age because its values range from 0 to 223.10 hours while Age ranges from 9 to 58 years old.\n",
    "4. Create a model specification with neighbours = tune(). For the “Pro” dataset, use K = 2 because it does not have enough data to be tuned.\n",
    "5. Add the recipe and model to a workflow and use the tune_grid function on the train/validation splits to estimate the accuracy for a range of K values (K = 1 to 10 due to limited data).\n",
    "6. Create a new model specification with the best K value and retrain the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using each dataset’s model with the best K value, apply it to the testing set and compute for its accuracy estimate and standard error when predicting a player’s subscription. To predict how different ages and number of hours played can affect subscription change among various player types, input various values for played hours and age in each model. From the results, there may be a different relationship between played hours vs. subscription and/or age vs. subscription for each player type.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, referring back to the broad question, we cannot use this model to predict what specific characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscription because it is only capable of predicting a value from the categorical variable. Furthermore, the players dataset is small, making it difficult to create an accurate model."
